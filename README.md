# Architecting Solutions on AWS

It explores architecting solutions on AWS in the context of four unique scenarios. Each week, you will be presented with a customer use case. You will then view videos that design a solution to meet the customerâ€™s needs, step by step. This process will result in an AWS architecture diagram at the end of each week. If you want to follow along and also design the AWS architectures, you can use various tools to build your diagram. To view drawing and diagramming tools, see 
AWS Architecture Icons.

We can use [Creately](https://app.creately.com/) for diagram / flowchart.
